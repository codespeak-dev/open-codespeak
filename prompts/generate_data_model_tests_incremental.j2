Your job is to generate an updated Django TestCase class that tests the Django models and their relationships based on the changes from old to new entities. {% include '_shared_test_requirements.j2' %}
12. Update existing tests to reflect model changes and add new tests for new models/fields
13. Remove tests for models/fields that no longer exist

Generate comprehensive tests that verify the updated models work correctly with the Django ORM.
Use the write_file tool to write the complete updated Django TestCase class to web/test_data_model.py.

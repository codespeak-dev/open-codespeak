Given Django models.py content, generate a proper Django TestCase class that tests the Django models and their relationships. {% include '_shared_test_requirements.j2' %}
Generate comprehensive tests that verify the models work correctly with the Django ORM.
Use the write_file tool to write the complete Django TestCase class to web/test_data_model.py.

<context path="web/models.py">
{{ models_content }}
